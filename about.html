    I am on a search for new better paths. Paths of higher levels of social organizing which can catalyze our humanity. I find myself obsessed with architectures of the non physical. As it appears, these are often the actual shapers of our world.

  <div class="body-statement-home">
    Currently living in Prague, CZ. I am passionate about open source, local distributed manufacturing, and equitable social models for the post capitalist economy. Such as commons networks/ecosystems, and recently crypto economics and <a href="https://holochain.org/">Holochain</a>.

    I help lead <a href="http://www.designdisco.org/">Design Disco</a>, a non-profit organization teaching design and design thinking to the youth. I belive everyone can be a designer because design is a problem solving strategy which sees no bordres between professions and disciplins.
