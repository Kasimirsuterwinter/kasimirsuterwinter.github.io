Over the past 3 years I have been involved in the co-creation of Design Disco. No, it is not a disco club. The "Disco" stands for Discovery, although we also like to have a good time. In this post I want to try and outline some of the lessons I have learned being part of this experiment, and my vision for the future of our organization.

First off I should share a bit of what this whole disco things is about. We are a non profit organization with the mission to show people the world through the window of design. Meaning, we essentially want everyone to discover design, and how they can use design thinking in their everyday lives to "dissolve" problems they face.

Schools teach science, humanities, sports, arts, and many other disciplines of thought and activity, however design is largely left out of the curriculum. We believe this needs to change, and so just started doing it ourselves. It all began as a group of friends in college, visiting high schools and sharing about design through a presentation and an exercise. It as really small and it was just an idea that was planted like a seed.

Fast forward to the present moment and we have come a really long way. We have taught over 1,000 students with over 600 volunteer hours by our incredible instructors. We have spread to Norway and Turkey, with around 60 volunteers in total.

This is exciting and all, however what have I learned along the way?

1. [Start Small](Start small)
2. [Dream big](Dream big)
3. [Organizations/teams are alive](Organizations/teams are alive)
4. [The greatest human motivations are intrinsic not extrinsic]()
5. [For all the intrinsic motivation and nice ideas about living social organisms. We are all human.]()

1. **Start small**

This has been a big personal lesson. Often it is very fun to start new projects, and have new ideas. However, if you get hung up on large fantastical ideas, it becomes really overwhelming to bring it back down to earth and take real actions towards achieving all those ideas. So start small, don't overwhelm yourself. If its meant to happen, it will take off in time. The worst thing to do is squish a good idea because of inpatients, or give up right before things were about to take off. Its a bit like gardening. If you plant a seed, you won't see any activity for a few days and you might think it is dead, but then all of a sudden it will sprout and then the growth will continue exponentially until you can hardly believe you thought it was dead.

1. **Dream big**

This may sound contrary to the previous lesson, however it can be in fact be symbiotic. When starting new projects, the greater part of motivation to bring the idea to life, comes from the big dream of it. The potential you see in that idea. This is really important to catalyze engagement and bring people together around the same vision. It is also important to have a north star, a guiding vision or goal which you can check your progress against. Just remember, the big dream is not a fixed mandate. It can evolve, and most likely will evolve naturally. This is a good thing, its how the team or "social living organism" will grow and evolve.

1. **Organizations/teams are alive**

As I mentioned the term social living organism. I have learned to see teams and our whole organization as a kind of living organism. Seeing through this lens is crucial to cultivating an adaptive innovative social organism. How we name the world, influences our perception of the world. As Goethe put it, "How we see people is how we treat them, and how we treat them is who they become." I find this idea can be applied to communities of people. As soon as we see them as alive, we begin to treat them with life, and thus they become more alive. And what is the key characteristic of life? Well that is a much larger question, but in this situation I was thinking it is the capacity to evolve, adapt and collaborate. These are some of the key principles of a living system:

1. Divergent parts
2. convergent whole
3. dynamic relationships

Put succinctly: A living system integrates divergent parts, into a convergent whole, in dynamic relationship internally and externally, in an ongoing moment-by-moment process of self organizing and self creation.

1. **The greatest human motivations are intrinsic not extrinsic**

Being part of an all volunteer organization. I have come to realize that the greatest motivations for people are not extrinsic. Extrinsic motivations will certainly get people moving, but we don't want to just move. If we are a social living organism, we want to feel, empathize and steer our movement collectively. In order to unlock passion and innovation, we need to help one another find our intrinsic motivations. That which we desire to fulfill in our lives, that which gives us energy and life when we partake in it. Namely, we want to find meaningful, purposeful activities which we can collectively and individually find intrinsic motivations in.

1. **For all the intrinsic motivation and nice ideas about living social organisms. We are all human.**

I have found it is important to always remember we are all human beings. This translates to many insights.

1. We all see the world from our own point of view.
2. We are all free to act from our values.
3. We all need to have shelter, food and community.
4. We all make mistakes.
5. We can all learn and change.
6. We miss understand one another sometimes.
7. We are not as perfect as our dreams.
8. But we are all alive (similar to lesson 3).

I am sure there are many more lessons and I may come to update this post in the future as they become apparent to me. However for now that feels complete.
