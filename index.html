  <div class="body-statement-home">
    In my free time I am an open source enthusiast, who dreams of free open design and local distributed manufacturing, with an equitable business model!

  <div class="body-statement-home">
    I help lead <a href="http://www.designdisco.org/">Design Disco</a>, a non-profit organization teaching design and design thinking to the youth. I belive everyone can be a designer because design is a problem solving strategy which sees no bordres between professions and disciplins.
