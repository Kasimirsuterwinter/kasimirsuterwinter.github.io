### Painting with Light

There is a beautiful process to working with black and white film photography, from shooting to darkroom developing and editing. It takes you on a continuous journey, exploring the outer world, and then exploring the inner world. This process is almost meditative for me, and helps me value each and every photo as a special memory or piece of art. In the digital age we inhabit, this is a valuable process for me to connect with the story telling and the slower rhythms of meanings and purpose in life.
