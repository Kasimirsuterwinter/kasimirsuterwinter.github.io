### What would your space look like?

One of my first tasks in architecture school, was to define exactly this. Given a limited area in our school, how would I design it if I had to spend one full month living there.

I exercised many ideas of collective and individual space, of fresh open air flow and calm cozy spaces. And ultimately created what I might call a living lung.

Each circular tube represents a room, storage space or foot hole. The middle is defined by semi transparent hanging garden of plants. And the surroundings walls are cubby hole of different spaces and activity zones.
