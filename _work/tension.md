### Simple, collaborative, temporary, natural.

I love to spend time in nature, and often what deters me from inhabiting wild spaces is the notion that my habituate, limits and destroys that of other living creatures. In this project, I began by trying to imagine a structure which once built, could be left to nature, and would ultimately biodegrade and become apart of the natural landscape and future nutrients for the wildlife.

The resulting structure takes inspiration from the fashion design industry. Using thin plywood panels cut in specific shapes, and sewn together to create an organic and self stabilising shell. One of the greatest difficulties in designing clothing, is how to create garments which can take into account the many diverse and complex curves of the body, while ultimately being created out of flat pieces of cloth. This logic, lends itself well to digital fabrication and flat pack transportation which is highly efficient with standardised, two dimensional materials.

The shape of this structure could be easily customised to needs. And the assembly would be possible with a few able bodied humans and a large length of natural rope. Once abandoned it would not take long for the elements to do their work, and return the carbon to the soil from where it came.
