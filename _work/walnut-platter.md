### Hand made, heart felt. 

A simple, Japanese inspired wood platter for serving food, and preparing it. The top is implanted with dishes for different foods, while the bottom is flat for cutting and preparing food on.

The wood chose, is the dark heart wood of the Black Walnut tree. There is no additional colouring or finishing other than natural oil for longevity.
