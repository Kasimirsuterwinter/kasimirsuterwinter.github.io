# Kasimir Suter Winter

I am an architect by training, but I have started dabling in web coding. Really enjoying it and finding alot of inspiration in the computer and network architectures. Maybe the title "architect" used in the coding world is even more acurate than that used int the actual profession of Architecture. 

My site is free to copy and personalize for your own portfolio. It is built with Jekyll and CSS grid. I had a lot of fun buildng it and learning along the way. 

I also publish articles so feel free to check out the blog at [kasimirsuterwinter.github.io/blog](kasimirsuterwinter.github.io/blog)
