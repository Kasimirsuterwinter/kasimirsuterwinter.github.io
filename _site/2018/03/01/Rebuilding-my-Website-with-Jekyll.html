      <p>For years I have been struggling with wordpress and it’s many plugins and themes. This lead me to slowly learn more and more HTML and CSS. I never liked the idea of coding a website from scratch. But when I learned about git I had this magnificent idea about how website templates could be built in github and then hosted directly from the repository and then everyone would be able to fork and submit pull requests for any website on the internet. Well, low and behold I learned about Github Pages a few years later and my prayers were answered.</p>

<p>The one piece which I had not anticipated, and which made all the difference and finally inspired me to really get my hands into the code, was Jekyll. I could hardly believe how powerful this software could be for the proliferation of experimental and new designs on the internet. With Jekyll’s capacity to compile just about anything, their versatility would allow for easy forking and sharing of a wide variety of website design ideas.

<p>Fast forward four years and its 2018. I finally decided to rebuild my personal website to learn how to use Jekyll and Liquid templating. I was simultaneously inspired by Jen Simmons and her talks about the revolution of CSS Grid. I had always been overwhelmed by the complicated CSS hacks for creating interesting designs. But finally there was a way to do it completely intuitively. This gave me the final motivation to build a Jekyll site, host it on gh pages and build it with CSS Grid. For me this is the ultimate web design combination as it allows for easy remixing of designs since the CSS does not rely on HTML elements for design, and easy access to code, since everything is hosted in a Github repository.</p>

<p>Thank you for reading, and I hope you get a chance to try out Jekyll. I also  want to through a link in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qof0XB0yaDs&amp;t=825s">her</a> for a great talk by Jen Simmons about the future of design on the web.</p>
